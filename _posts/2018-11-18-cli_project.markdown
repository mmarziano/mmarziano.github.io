So I've been struggling with the speed with which I'm moving through the Learn.co full stack curriculum but I finally made it to the CLI Gem Project.  I ended up going backwards and redo-ing several of the previous lessons and labs.  I think that helped me get through the interaction of different classes and figuring out how to scrape other sites.  I initially thought of scraping YouTube and StackOverflow by creating a gem that allowed someone to input a search term and the gem would return the first few pertinent results.  About midway through, I changed course (because I was planning a family trip to Disney and often frequent www.undercovertourist.com for travel insights) and decided to create a gem for that instead.  

I began by watching Avi's videos on getting a gem started and simply began to write code.  I didn't worry about setting up my environment and file tree and struggled after with the right 'require' statements.  I got my code to work in one file and without dependencies and then began the refactor process working on my different classes in an attempt to honor the "single responsibility" rule.  After much trial and error and several debugging attempts, I've complete my gem ([https://github.com/mmarziano/undercover_tourist_cli.git]. My final step is getting gem ready for publishing and submitted for review.  Fingers crossed!
