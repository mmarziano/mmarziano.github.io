So I've finally made it to my second project, a web application built on the Sinatra framework.  I currently volunteer a my kids' school as a member of the PTA organization.  Relying on that experience (and the various pain points of organizing multiple fundraising events throughout the year), I decided to gear my project towards something that could address many of those issues.  

PTYAY is a web application that manages to organize fundraising campaigns and team member tasks.  As I started coding the "guts" of the program I kept finding myself saying "won't it be great if..." a certain feature exists.  I allowed myself to follows those thoughts and found myself able to incorporate many of those desires into the program.  I found that Google is a good friend and an excellent resource for stretching our coding capabilities.  

I approached this project with a general overview of what I wanted it to perform.  I quickly sketched my models on paper and created the migrations to set up the database.  I found that as I wrote more code and wanted to increase the functionality, I needed to modify my schema and ended up with multiple migrations throughout the course of the project.
I also discovered that working with 'tux' and 'shotgun' were invaluable, as they allowed me to interact with my database and views in real time.  

Ultimately, as in the CLI project before this one, I found my comfort level with the subject matter increasing by the day.  This exercise has reinforced the MVC concept and has allowed me to understand the overarching way of how web applications work.
