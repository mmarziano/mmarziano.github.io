Several years ago, I approached my boss and commented about the horrid appearance of my organization's website.  It was squarely stuck in the 90's with prominent yellow color and boxy text.  So I decided to revamp it and absolutely had no idea how to do it.  I faked it until I made it.  I began with using a web-based program that allowed you to graphically create the page; however, it was better suited for landing pages.  I quickly discovered that I needed to go the HTML/CSS route (after much Googling).  For the next four months, I played with <div> and <class> and <id>.  I tried to make sense of floats and relative and absolute positioning.  I struggled with margins and padding.  The struggle was real.  I spent many hours decrying the lack of computer literacy courses throughout my educational career.  I guess what I'm saying is that a stint withi HTML/CSS broaden my curiosity for coding and has brought me here.

So how would I describe HTML/CSS to my mom?

I'd tell her it's like building a house.  The plans, drawings, foundation, and framing are the HTML.  They provide the structure of a home like HTML provides the structure of a website.  The paint, flooring, window coverings and more dress up the house just like CSS makes website beautiful and interesting to see.
