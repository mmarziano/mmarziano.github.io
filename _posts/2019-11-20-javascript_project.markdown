So...here I am at the cusp of seemingly completing my Javascript project, a single page application (SPA) that utilizes a Ruby backend for database management and I'm still in awe of how much I've learned and how little I know.  The Rails project emphasized the MVC model with numerous page redirects and varied controller actions.  With Javascript, I had to set that all aside to focus on DOM manipulation and asynchronous calls to the database via fetch().  ***Bangs head on table***.  Fortunately, the curriculum changed as I was approaching the project and I opted to redo the Javascript section which proved incredibly beneficial.  I have a better grasp of the incredible role Javascript plays in front end web development and the versatility of Rails to serve as an api-only backend.  My one main wish would be for an easier way to debug in Javascript.  Until then, long live 'console.log'!
