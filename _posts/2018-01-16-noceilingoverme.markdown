Curiosity and learning are two of my defining characteristics.  The world of programming has fascinated me for some time.  I always enjoyed my computer classes in high school (Mavis Teaches Typing and QBASIC) but never considered the world of computers as a career.  So I went on to study something else and came out with a very useful and practical degree in film producation.  #Stilljobsearching.  I ended up becoming a teacher because, you know, bills have to be paid, and took advantage of the flexible schedule to get an MBA.    Since then I have been the CFO of the school.

A ceiling was placed over my head, and I'll be damned if I allow it to stay there for long.  So here I am, writing a short blog entry about why I wanted to learn programming.  The short answer is: I think it's cool and it's my way of proving to myself and the world that glass ceilings are meant to be broken.
